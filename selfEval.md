# Self Evaluation

- Reflect on your time management and awareness of where you spend time. Is this a strength or area you are working on? What support do you need in this area? And/or, what tips do you have to share with your classmates in this area?

I can often get distracted but through mod0 I have been surprisingly productive, and hopefully the current level of productivity will create good habits for the future.

- How would you explain to a 5 year old what a function is?

A function is something you can use over and over without the need to rebuild it every time.

- Share your understanding of arguments and parameters.

Parameters are variables declared in the creation of a function that must be filled by parameters every time the function is ran.

- What questions/topics (related to Functions) do you want to being to your Small Group?

I don't have any particular questions but I'm looking forward to nesting functions =]
